        An inspiring Web Developer who is passionate about expanding my knowledge on modern web technologies. I am still inexperienced but plan to gain some in the near future. Making use of the things I learned and adding projects and information to my portfolio. If I would say, I prefer web design because I like designing stuff and would say I have a talent for web design.
